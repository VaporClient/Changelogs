### **VaporClient 1.0 BETA-3 Changelog**

Date: 5 january 2025

- Added AdvancedBookCrasher (still in beta)
- Added discord integration (RPC)
- Added alt memory system
- Added lag meter in HUD
- Added ForgeSpoof Modern (1.13-1.20) BETA:
  At the moment ForgeSpoof Modern doesn't work on servers with game selectors (lobby servers),
  in fact after you click to join the gamemode, the player gets stuck in the lobby server indefinitely.
  It only works with single forge servers (WE ARE PLANNING TO FIX THIS IN THE NEXT UPDATES).
  For modern versions you don't need to add any mod in the client section since it's all automatic.
- Updated ProtocolSpoofer
